## A data-selfie? Turn data into art on your phone
<br /><br />
###### BACKGROUND 
Many  websites  and  fitness  apps gather pedometer and location data, but the output has a cold, clinical feel of infographics. Inspired by the artist Laurie Frick and developed by thirteen23, this app has the characteristics of hand crafted watercolor drawings and  attempts  to  change  the  way  you  see  the  data gathered about you. FRICKbits uses your location data to draw the patterns of where you travel in a city, or for that matter – anywhere on the globe. The repetition of travel patterns and stray movements can transform into a data portrait of you. A data-selfie.
<br /><br />
###### DESCRIPTION
FRICKbits gathers occasional location data, a clever means to not have any noticeable impact on battery life and shows actual location with tiny monotone dots and brightly colored patterns on a minimalist Mapbox layout. While the user can choose and change color palette at any time, they ‘ earn’  smaller colored bits and clusters for the locations traveled most frequently. Long stretches of pattern stand in for the occasional and high-speed movements. Location data accumulates, and the pattern gathers richness and texture over time. Touch the screen and you shift back and forth from the actual map to the abstract art of your travels.
<br />
As  for  privacy,  the  data  belongs  only  to  the  user, you  gather  occasional  iOS  location  data  and  the  appdisplays  it  on the  phone. The  app  runs  entirely  on the iOS  devise  with  no  server  backend.  It’ s  up  to  the FRICKbits user to share, tweet or post the art. One button lets you clear or export the data at any time.
<br /><br />
###### WHY OPEN SOURCE?
Launched in Fall of 2014, FRICKbits was a collaboration between Laurie Frick, an artist and thirteen23 an applications developer. Long-story short, thirteen23 has a lobby installation of their chat metadata and Frick got an app that demonstrates the experience of turning data into art on a phone. It was never intended as a money-making endeavor, and while it required massive devotion from an amazing team at thirteen23, it’ s a good time to let others play with it, make it into a new application or get a chance to directly fiddle with the notion of turning data into art.
